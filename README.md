# Video to MP3

### I made this script because I grew up in the time of Limewire and a myriad of youtube-to-mp3 converters.
### Some of my favorite Lil Wayne songs were never on wax officially. While Datpiff came in handy, there are some versions of songs in the ether that I can bet you wish you had still. Or maybe you wish your favorite chopped and screwed version could finally make it to your ipod.


### I'll have more sentimental things to put here later but hopefully this helps you when you need it most.

**Required Libraries**
